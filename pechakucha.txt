- should have:
	- well thought out exploratory analysis
	- good sense for the purpose of the predictions in the context of the use case
	- what is the use case?
	- who is the user?
	- how does the app put the model into the hands of a non-technical decision maker?
	- who is creating the app?
	- have you created something that is usable by the client?

- slide 1: what is the business as usual approach to the planning problem?
- slide 2: what is the proposed data driven approach?
- slide 3: what is the data?
- slide 4: exploratory analysis (spatial process) <- what is spatial process? spatial trends?
- slide 5: exploratory analysis
- slide 6: how does the model work in theory? features, spatial process, etc
- slide 7-9: app wireframes
- slide 9 again: also conclusion

- notes from the project option description
	- "to better allocate prevention resources"
	- think critically about how you might offer these predictions to a public health official in your app
	- what do they want to know?
	- keep in mind your predictions will be about overdoses but may also simply be places where people are using heroin
