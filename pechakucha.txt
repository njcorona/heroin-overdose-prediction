- should have:
	- well thought out exploratory analysis
		- 
	- good sense for the purpose of the predictions in the context of the use case
	- what is the use case?
	- who is the user?
	- how does the app put the model into the hands of a non-technical decision maker?
	- who is creating the app?
	- have you created something that is usable by the client?

- slide 1: what is the business as usual approach to the planning problem?
- slide 2: what is the proposed data driven approach?
- slide 3: what is the data?
- slide 4: exploratory analysis (spatial process) <- what is spatial process? spatial trends?
- slide 5: exploratory analysis
- slide 6: how does the model work in theory? features, spatial process, etc
- slide 7-9: app wireframes
- slide 9 again: also conclusion

- notes from the project option description
	- "to better allocate prevention resources"
	- think critically about how you might offer these predictions to a public health official in your app
	- what do they want to know?
	- keep in mind your predictions will be about overdoses but may also simply be places where people are using heroin

- is there a crime categorization for _selling_ drugs?

capitalize on the success that non-medical peers have been having in bringing down overdose deaths because it seems like ems and first responders have taken advantage of open data and more data sharing to better allocate their ems resources already.
